We propose a decentralized KYC/AML gateway on the Algorand blockchain that verifies user identity via email + phone number checks, leveraging your existing Swift Email Verifier API and a third-party phone validation service. 

 This system uses a stateful Algorand smart contract to enforce payments, quotas, and audit trails on-chain, ensuring transparency and tamper-proof logs.

 An off-chain oracle backend listens for validation requests, invokes the APIs, and returns results via 0-ALGO transactions. 

 Integrations with DAOs, marketplaces, and tokenized access unlock new revenue models and community-driven identity reputations. 

 This architecture meets global KYC/AML regulations, deters bots/fraud, and positions your company as a blockchain-first innovator. 

 1. Problem Statement & Market Opportunity
1.1 Rising Regulatory Demands
Fintech and crypto firms face escalating KYC/AML requirements to prevent money laundering, fraud, and terrorist financing—fines can exceed tens of millions of dollars for non-compliance. 

 Major regulators in the US, EU, and Asia stipulate customer due diligence, ongoing transaction monitoring, and record-keeping.

1.2 Fractured Identity Verification
Traditional KYC/AML flows rely on centralized vendors, siloed databases, and manual reviews—incurring high costs (US$10 – 50 per user), slow onboarding (days), and single points of failure. 

 Crypto DAOs and on-chain marketplaces lack native identity layers, exposing them to Sybil attacks, bots, and regulatory risk. 


1.3 Demand for Web3-Native Solutions
The Web3 ecosystem is hungry for decentralized, privacy-preserving identity frameworks that are interoperable across dApps and chains, minimize trust, and reduce KYC costs—especially for token sales, DeFi platforms, and NFT marketplaces.
